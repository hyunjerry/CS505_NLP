He later restated Valve ' s position, \" Until we have the to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don ' t really see us moving to that platform \". At Sony ' E3 2010 press conference, Newell made appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony ' s move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system.

The metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in economic consumption; the filaments be installed with large loops that tightened in use. This made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile. Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re - welding, though this would commonly decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament.

Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the appearance had uncovered promising performers, said that American Idol \" isn ' t really about music. It ' s about all the bad aspects of the music business – the arrogance of commerce, this sensory faculty of ' I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don ' t know. ' \" That American Idol is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry. LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that \" Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award \". It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others.
